# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

Purpose of the analysis is to use Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, generate a multiple-line graph that shows weekly fares for each city type applying Pandas and Matplotlib. Finally, make a decision recommendation based on how the data differs by city type using PyBer and how those differences can tell a story.




## Results

The analysis shows Urban city type had the most number of rides (1625), driver count (2405) and the highest number of fares (39854). Suburban followed with 625, 490 and 19356 repectively for rides, drivers and fares respectively. Rural cities recorded the least count for rides, drivers and fares. Fig 7 below displays the trend.

Average fares per ride showed the rural cites recorded highest average count of 34.62 followed by suburban cities with 30.97 and finally urban cities of 24.52.
Average fare per driver was similarly high for rural cities at 55.48, then suburban cities at 39.50 then urban cities at 16.57. Fig 6 and Fig 8 display the summary dataframes for the analysis.

## Summary

Eventhogh rural cities had fewer total rides as compared to urban cities, rural cities recorded the most average fares. Suburban cities were average between the urban and rural city types in all areas.

Based on the results, the following business recommendations can be made:

A strategy should be developed to increase the total rides and drivers for the rural cities.
The average fares for the urban cities should be further investigated and strategy implemented to make it more profitable.
Implement a strategy to close the gap between suburban and urban total number of rides. More rides for Suburban cities.
